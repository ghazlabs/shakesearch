admiration, though the catalogue of his endowments had been tabled by
his side, and I to peruse him by items.

PHILARIO.
You speak of him when he was less furnish’d than now he is with that
which makes him both without and within.

FRENCHMAN.
I have seen him in France; we had very many there could behold the sun
with as firm eyes as he.

IACHIMO.
This matter of marrying his king’s daughter, wherein he must be weighed
rather by her value than his own, words him, I doubt not, a great deal
from the matter.

FRENCHMAN.
And then his banishment.

IACHIMO.
Ay, and the approbation of those that weep this lamentable divorce
under her colours are wonderfully to extend him, be it but to fortify
her judgement, which else an easy battery might lay flat, for taking a
beggar, without less quality. But how comes it he is to sojourn with
you? How creeps acquaintance?

PHILARIO.
His father and I were soldiers <mark>together</mark>, to whom I have been often
bound for no less than my life.

    Enter Posthumus.

Here comes the Briton. Let him be so entertained amongst you as suits
with gentlemen of your knowing to a stranger of his quality. I beseech
you all be better known to this gentleman, whom I commend to you as a
noble friend of mine. How worthy he is I will leave to appear
hereafter, rather than story him in his own hearing.

FRENCHMAN.
Sir, we have known <mark>together</mark> in Orleans.

POSTHUMUS.
Since when I have been debtor to you for courtesies, which I will be
ever to pay and yet pay still.

FRENCHMAN.
Sir, you o’errate my poor kindness. I was glad I did atone my
countryman and you; it had been pity you should have been put <mark>together</mark>
with so mortal a purpose as then each bore, upon importance of so
slight and trivial a nature.
